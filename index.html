            <h2>Art of Design</h2>
            <div class="pindent">
                <p>Web Design is now one of my favorite things to do and a big reason is because there's virtually no limits to what can be created. Web Design is only limited by technology which, as you know, is only advancing every single day. The technology used today for Web Design already gives us the tools and power to create almost anything we can imagine.</p>
                <p class="topp">I've only just started learning Web Design and I've created this Website to demonstrate some of what I've learned thus far and to demonstrate why I like Web Design. It's only been about 35 days, but I've already learned a lot of cool things.
                    <br>Please click the links above to checkout some of the projects I've been working on as well as the links to view the color palate I used for this website and the picture gallery I added for some fun and entertainment.</p>

                <h3>My First Page</h3>
                <p>I designed my first page around my love for music but spent most of my time discovering new things and experimenting with them. I pushed the limits with almost everything and had a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed working with radiant colors and finding out all the neat things that I could do with them. It seems the possibilities are endless when it comes to working with radiant colors and I especially enjoyed adding them to another one of my favorite things that I've learned so far; the fixed heading.</p>
                <h3>Pacific Trails Resort &amp; JavaJam</h3>
                <p>Pacific Trails Resort is the case study I've been working on for the course I'm taking on Web Design and JavaJam is another case study that I found my textbook that I decided to do as well. </p>
                <p>Although the JavaJam wasn't a requirement for the course, I'm glad that I did it because I learned a lot of things and had a lot of fun! Plus, we all know what they say is really true;
                    <br> practice makes perfect!</p><img id="floatright" src="images/11111.jpg" alt="waterfall" height="152" width="225">
                <h3>Picture Gallery</h3>
                <p>Creating a picture gallary is just one more thing about Web Design that I really enjoy. Creating a picture gallery is a great way to not only share pictures with family and friends, but it is also an area that can add some entertainment for them and anyone else who may be visiting the site. </p>
                <p>One of the best things about Web Design is the moment a site you designed goes live and the site becomes available for anybody in the World to see!
